Potion Duplication and brewing Sickness potions no longer have a random RNG check to prevent level gain.
Alchemy actions have a 1/5 chance to level up(from 1/6)

Reduced base chances of leveling Magic and Casting levels

Mana Cost Weight Leveling Change: Spells that cost more than certain thresholds will boost level chance(Max 100% chance)
If a spell costs more than 35 mana, greatly boost chances of leveling
If a spell costs more than 20 Mana, moderately boost chances of leveling
If a spell costs more than 12 mana, slightly boost chances of leveling

SOFT CODED SECRET ROOM SPAWNING MECHANICS, NOW LOCATED AT ./maps/secretrooms.txt
    Breakdown:
        each row of text within secretrooms.txt must be formatted as "1:secretroom:100"
            "1" = The floor the secret room is assigned to
            "secretroom" = The name of the map file(lmp) that will be generated
            "100" = The chance(effectively in %) that the secret room will spawn, so 100 is a 100% of the secret room spawning.
        For now the "0:NULL:0" must exist as a fallback for cases where no secret room is configure to spawn.
